description: "App that generates a .xlsx remediation plan from a set of scan results augmented with text from JSON configuration files. Custom text is added when flaw criteria is met (such as a CWE ID, module name, file or line number). This allows custom text such as internal workflows, wiki links, training, code snippets, 2nd party information or other languages into the auto generated remediation plan. Enables app sec teams to triage large volumes of flaws quickly whilst sharing a core advice repository in code."
