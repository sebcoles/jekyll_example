I enjoy sharing stories and insights from my adventures in DevSecOps transformation and organisational change for the benefit of protecting customer data. I like my talks to be accessible to everyone, so they tend not to be technical and focus on the social skills required to make an impact. I cover topics such as Change Management, Leadership, Influence and Building Great Teams. Below are some of the links and presentations I have given in the past. If you feel the content of my talks would benefit your speaking event or organisation - lets chat!

<b>Tools are not the Answer - Leadership and Change in DevSecOps</b>

In this talk I discuss using Kotter's 8 Steps when planning DevSecOps roadmaps, and demonstrate what that would look like. I also discuss my approach for developing new leaders and my experiments with business theory, such as Porters 5 Forces and Value Stream Mapping, with intrapreneurship. 

# IDC DevOps (2023) - St Albans
## DevSecOps Leadership - Zero to Herp
I was fortunate enough to attend a great 2 day conference with IDC at Sopwell House in St Albans. I was a "User Keynote Speaker" - whatever that means! But yes, best conference I've been too, great company, food, drinks and entertainment, certainly recommend.

# Bristech (2019) - Bristol

<b>Security Cultures & Cheap Talk</b>

In this talk I implore that need for shared language and education when it comes to application security. I give a 101 on risk terminology, how CVSS works and why its lets about the score but the narrative of the questions. I also discuss developer threat modelling, a way of fitting in threat modelling into a sprint cadence.

# TechExeter (2019) - Exeter

My first "proper" conference presentation where I had a lecture theatre and a filled room. Really enjoyed it and exeter uni was a great venue, I actually got a speakers gift from this event of a locking pick set and sunglasses. I discuss running an AppSec project at the hydro and how security is a people problem.

<b>Developer Threat Modelling</b>

A 5 minute lightening talk I presented on developer threat modelling - a way of fitting threat modelling into a sprint cadence that we embedded at the Hydrographic Office. Fun Fact: I was up till 3am the night before walking my 1 year old daughter around the hotel lobby as she wouldn't sleep. Kids.
