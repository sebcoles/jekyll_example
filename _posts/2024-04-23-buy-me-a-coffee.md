Hi there! If you like what you read, and it's providing value, considering <b>supporting me</b> buy tipping a coffee! I pretty much live of caffeine and my favorite haunt is Cafe Nero.

I use the [Natwest PayIt](https://www.natwest.com/business/business-services/payit-hub/payit.html) service which use Open Banking to enable you to secure push a payment to my personal account using my [PayIt Link](https://paymentrequest.natwestpayit.com/reusable-links/d5f75869-2cb5-4b65-9ef8-d714cb9bc007) or the below QR card. There is no service or credit card charges in using this service, pretty neat. The going price of a flat white at Cafe Nero Â£3.50!
