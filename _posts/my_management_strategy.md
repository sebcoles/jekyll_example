# Management

My belief is that management is about building high performance at an individual and team level. High performing individuals and teams deliver the right stuff, faster.

## My Root of Management

There are two simple, difficult and related problems that I believe are my mission as a manager to improve. These problems are not solvable but they are manageable and require intentional effort to improve. If you have these two items in check I believe you will have a high performance staff and teams.

- Decision Making
- Psychological Safety

These two are always in battle. The more ruthless the decision making is, the more effective the process at challenging and feeding back on decision making, the better our decisons on what and how to work become. However at the same time, the more resilience we need to be as humans to go through the process. If our resilience isn't up to the task, the decision making process is circumvented and less optimal structures form.

As a manager my job is to ensure decision making, including my own, is up to scrutiny. At the same time I need to enable people to feel safe enough to engage, and indeed seek, the toughest of decision making. This takes a variety of skills from systems analysis to coaching, and is the toughest problem I have ever encountered.

### Decision Making

Decision making is our ability to take novel scenarios, seek data from records, social sources and experimentation, and to objectively assess options forward taking into account a diversity of opinions. And to rinse and repeat until a good enough solution is in place. Good decision taking takes time and is uncomfortable. Good decision making manages emotion out of the process.

### Psychological Safety

Psychological Safety is the amount of courage one needs to provide and receive authentic direct feedback. Historically our ancestors may have been afraid of the wild beasts. Today the wild beasts of our concrete and virtual jungles is the threat of emotional pain. Everyone is different, the "amount" of perceived psychology safety is not shared by those experiencing the same environment. Nor is the "amount" of psychological safety needed to be able to provide authentic feedback equal. However creating an environment of psychological safety is indeed my challenge as a manager. There are techniques such as leadership which foster a feeling of safety, thus making it easier to comply and engage with decision making.
