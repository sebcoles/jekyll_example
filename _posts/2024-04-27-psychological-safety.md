# Psychological Safety

When we feel safe we can make rational decisions. We can be authentic and provide honest feedback. The state of feeling safe is required to perform individually and with peers. Feeling safe is a scale that fluctuates with every meeting and the people involved. We must recognise the power of safety and prepare for enabling it within ourselves and others.

## Helping yourself feel safe

There are techniques to help you feel psychologically safer.

### Internal Networking 

Networking internally within an organisation and making friends before you need them is the most effective way to help you feel safe. If you have new projects on the horizon, go and meet your stakeholders and peers before the kick off. Networking internally is not like external networking - you already share something with everyone in that you all work for the same company trying to deliver value. They have objectives - ask what they are! They have challenges - ask what they are! They had a weekend - ask how it was! This is much easier BEFORE you need something or have an agenda, it's a far more pleasant experience for all. I preach to my team to go and meet people, make friends before your need them. Simple having a positive experience with someone BEFORE needing to work together sets everyone on the path to safety.

### Acceptance

We are humans and we are all trying to do whats best for our us and our families. And that's OK! We all have objectives to meet, and most of the time they will not be aligned. I may need something that requires them to deviate from what they need to achieve, it is understandable if that results in frustration and anger. Have compassion and forgive people, even before it happens. If your expecting a fight, you will get a fight. If you lead with understanding, you will get less fights. You cannot prevent all fights, but remember psychological safety is required by both parties. If the second party is unsafe then irrational reasoning occurs - and you can't reason with it. Forgive them, accept it and find safety.

## Helping other feels safe

### Listen and Mirror

Give space for the participant to talk freely. Let them vent, let them express, and just listen. Then when they stop, simply mirror what you heard back to show that you were listening. You can play back the words in your own or simply repeat the last sentence as a question also works. You don't have to agree to the remarks, simple acknowledge receipt by replaying. Feeling heard and understood puts you on the path to safety.

### Certainty

The threat of unknown events encourages fear. You can fight that by providing certainty - where that
